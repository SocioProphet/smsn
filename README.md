# Welcome to Semantic Synchrony!

## The experience | Why

Semantic Synchrony lets anyone edit and use a knowledge graph. That's what Google, Siri, Alexa and others use to answer questions about the world. Semantic Synchrony, however, is easy: There are only about 25 commands you need to know, and the entire [introductory video course](https://github.com/synchrony/smsn/wiki/A-video-introduction-to-Semantic-Synchrony) takes less than 45 minutes.

Some essays on the benefits of personal knowledge mapping have been collected at [smsn-why](https://github.com/synchrony/smsn-why).

## The software | How
Disclaimer (and good news!): Semantic Synchrony is [evolving](https://github.com/synchrony/smsn-why/blob/master/caution-unstable.md).

### Installing it
Semantic Synchrony is among the easier Docker applications to [install](https://github.com/synchrony/smsn/wiki/installation) -- just run the Docker container, add a few lines to your .emacs config file, start Emacs, and run the `smsn-mode` command. You don't need to be good at Emacs.

### Using it
This brief [howto](https://github.com/synchrony/smsn/wiki/What-you-need-to-know-to-use-Semantic-Synchrony) explains everything you will need to know to use Semantic Synchrony. It assumes no prior familiarity with Emacs, knowledge graphs, or any other technology. (For a brief list of critical commands, or the complete list, see the [smsn-mode wiki](https://github.com/synchrony/smsn-mode/wiki).

### Escaping it (is easy)
Fear not the commitment! Semantic Synchrony exports to many formats, including plain text, with one file corresponding to each note in the graph. Even shared authorship is escapable, because the whole history of changes can be kept in Git.

### Hacking it
Please see the [invitation to coders](https://github.com/synchrony/smsn-why/blob/master/invitations/to-coders.md).
