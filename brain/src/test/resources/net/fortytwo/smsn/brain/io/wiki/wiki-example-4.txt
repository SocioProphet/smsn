    · :n3s0h_y: after an initial period of education by female tutors, the James boys' father sent them to a series of establishments in England, France, Switzerland, and Germany that "endeavored to teach them foreign languages, introduce them to arithmetic, and generally uncover their young talents"

    + :Jvj2yWW: "There could not be a more entertaining treat than dinner at the James house, when all the young people  were at home.  They were full of stories of the oddest kind, and discussed quiestions of morals or taste or literature with a vociferous vigor so great as sometimes to lead the young men to leave their seats and gesticulate on the floor.  I remember, in some of these heated discussions, it was not unusual for the sons to invoke humorous curses on their parent, one of which was, that "his mashed potatoes might always have lumps in them!"

    · :Ez1ezKN: this is a section heading in an article from the October 1994 issue of Scientific American which I so vividly remember reading when I was a teenager.  I have just now (2015-01-02) found an online copy of the article, but it has stuck with me all these years.  The illustration, not in the online copy, shows a man deciding between an apple and a banana while correspondingly colored hexagons in a honeycomb like pattern above his head compete for a majority decision.  I referred to this article several years later in one of my journals, thinking that it had been written by one William James, but corrected myself; William H. Calvin had written the article, giving credit to James's ideas.
