The above mentioned elements are, in my case of visual and some of a muscular type.... Conventional words or other signs [presumably mathematical ones] have to be sought for laboriously only in a secondary stage, when the associative play already referred to is sufficiently established and can be reproduced at will"

        · :tWHr_wY: a basic kind of language consists of linking basic symbols to sense impressions. A further stage deals with associations between those symbols.  If language is to lead to understanding, there must be rules concerning the relations between the signs on the one hand, and on the other hand, there must be a stable correspondence between signs and impressions.  As children, we learn these rules by intuition, but when we become aware of them, grammar is established.  When language becomes relatively independent of the background of impressions, a greater inner coherence is attained.  Only at this further stage of development, where frequent use is made of abstract concepts, language becomes an instrument of reasoning in the true sense of the word.  At the same time, however, language becomes misleading if the connection with sense impressions is lost.

        · :S-nFME2: what distinguishes the language of science from ordinary language?  Science strives for precision and clarity of concepts as regards their interrelation and their correspondence to sensory data.  E.g. Euclidean geometry is based on a small set of axioms and is linked to the physical act of measurement.

        · :fQ0dJDi: science is driven by the goal of understanding, but it does not itself inform the goals of mankind.  Rather, it is a tool which can be used for different ends.  Perfection of means and confusion of goals seem (in Einstein's view) to characterize the modern age.  If even a minority of mankind strives for the safety, the welfare, and the free development of the talent of mankind, they will not be denied the means, and their superiority will be proven in the long run.
