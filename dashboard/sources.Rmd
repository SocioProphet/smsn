## Data sources

```{r, echo = FALSE}
df <- as.data.frame(table(entities$source))
t.source <- data.frame(source=df$Var1, size=df$Freq)
sources <- unique(entities$source)
total.sources <- length(sources)
```

A SmSn knowledge base is organized into *data sources*, which are like buckets for graph data.
Each data source contains any number of entities and relationships, and any set of data sources may be combined to form a data set, or *graph*.
The current graph contains **`r num(total.sources)` data sources** with names and entity counts as below.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
showFreqTable(entities$source)
```
